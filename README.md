# notebooks

Notebooks with essential data science knowledge:
If your a practical learner here is my gathered knowledge about
statistics, coding in python, machine learning etc. in executable examples.

Data sets used in the notebooks are provided here:

The 'abc' notebooks comprise a ample and growing tour of python from beginner to advanced topics.
In the 'abc' series you have  introductory notebooks for packages like pandas and numpy.
Pandas Advanced casts light on multiindex dataframes, pivot tables and openpyxlto working with
excel spreadsheets in python.

The 'essential' series is filled with statistics for example descriptive statistics, distributions,
confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, regression, gradient descent etc. and goes on with a review of
basic machine learning methods starting at 'essential_06'.

The math concepts and the coding implemenations are described in brief but sufficient manner.

If there is a fine online source for further information I included a link.

Since the notebooks are a reflection of my learning they are growing by the  day.
I use them as a reference. If you're an data scientist in the making I may have spared you a lot of work.
