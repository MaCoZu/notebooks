# notebooks
Notebooks with essential data science knowledge: 
a tour of python A-Z, some packages like pandas and numpy, 
statistics from simple concepts to advanced statistical stuff 
with short descriptions of their intent and functioning.
If there is a fine online source for further information 
I included a link.

The Notebooks are currently growing and a reflection of my learning,
as well as a reference for me and everybody who's interested
in these topics or my work.

Of course there is a lot of good material out there, what i am try
to do is building a series of notebooks that explain statistics and 
the Python implemention in a comprehensible an practical manner.
