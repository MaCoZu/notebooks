# notebooks

Notebooks with essential data science knowledge:
If your a practical learner here is my gathered knowledge about 
statistics, coding in python, machine learning etc. in executable examples.

Data sets used in the notebooks are provided here:

The notebooks comprise a ample and growing tour of python from beginner to advanced topics.
There are introductory notebooks for packages like pandas and numpy.
Furthermore notebooks filled with statistics for example 
descriptive statistics, distributions, confidence intervals, 
hypothesis testing, regression, gradient descent etc.

The math concepts and the coding implemenations are described,
annotations about code functioning is added for my own understanding and the possible reader.

The notebooks called 'essential' from 6-8, cover basic machine learning concepts. 

If there is a fine online source for further information I included a link.

Since the notebooks are a reflection of my learning they are growing every day.
I use them as a reference, if you're an data scientist to-be I may have spared you a lot of work.
